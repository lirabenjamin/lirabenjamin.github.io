For instance, films in the DC universe have varying scores, with darker, auteur-driven projects like 'The Dark Knight' achieving high scores. Given this film's unique positioning as a sequel to an already notable franchise and its artistic direction, a base rate slightly above average but below guaranteed high success (especially considering potential sequel effects) seems reasonable.

I looked at sequels within the comic book genre and psychological thrillers. Historically, sequels often perform slightly worse on average but can perform similarly if the first installment was well-received critically and commercially.

Sequels often perform similarly to their predecessors but can also have slightly lower scores due to heightened expectations. Additionally, films featuring major characters like the Joker often have a base level of fan interest which can press reviewers to be more lenient. Given these factors and the specific nature of this sequel being a musical, which could influence critical reception, a reasonable base rate estimate could align with how films in this genre and franchise perform. Generally, comic book-related sequel films tend to have about a 70-80% chance of scoring above 60.

Historically, Anheuser-Busch has been a lead sponsor and major advertiser in the Super Bowl for decades. In recent years, however, viewing and advertising dynamics have shifted slightly due to various factors like streaming and changing viewer demographics. While Anheuser-Busch slightly reduced their Super Bowl ad presence recently, they still manage to advertise heavily during this event.

Secondly, while xAI is an innovative entity led by Elon Musk, which may incline them towards making impactful and bold marketing moves, they are also relatively new, which often correlates with financial prudence concerning very high-cost advertising slots. Historical trends show that tech companies do sporadically participate in such advertisements, but mainly when they have grown significantly or are launching a major product. Lastly, given the cost associated and the audience targeting, the likelihood that xAI will choose a different, potentially more targeted, marketing strategy exists.

Historically, several tech companies, such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook, have run ads during the Super Bowl, but they are usually well-established, large companies. Anthropic, being a relatively newer AI research company, is less likely to invest in such high-cost advertising compared to these giants, especially if it operates similarly to other AI labs like OpenAI, which have not traditionally used Super Bowl ads as part of their strategy. Given these factors, a lower base rate is more appropriate. Based on these insights, I estimate the base rate at 0.1, reflecting both the uncertainty about Anthropic's financial priorities and the overall rarity of AI companies advertising in this venue."],["KXBAFTASUPACTO-25-JS","2025 BAFTA for Best Supporting Actor?","Jeremy Strong:: The Apprentice","Entertainment","no","If  Jeremy Strong has won Best Supporting Actor at the 78th BAFTA Awards, then the market resolves to Yes.","To estimate the base rate for Jeremy Strong winning the Best Supporting Actor at the BAFTA in 2025, we consider several factors: Firstly, analyze the historical win rate for nominees in this category to estimate an average probability.

Historically, winners of the BAFTA Best Leading Actor award are not always predictable and are influenced by factors like past nominations, current form, and industry buzz. Timothee Chalamet, being an acclaimed actor with multiple nominations in prestigious awards, including BAFTA and Oscars, suggests he is a strong contender. However, given the competitive nature, with at least 9 major nominees and potential additions, historically the chances for any singular nominee winning might be around 10%, assuming each has an equal chance.

Over the past decade, the Best Leading Actor award has been awarded to a mix of veteran actors and rising stars, with no individual consistently dominating. Ralph Fiennes is a respected actor with previous nominations, which increases his likelihood compared to newcomers but does not guarantee a win.

Conclave's base rate is calculated as 1 divided by the number of films plus a small adjustment for multi-winners, which means approximately 1\u002f10 since there is often a significant clustering of wins among a few top contenders."],["KXOSCARWIN-97-ACU","Which movie will win the most Oscars at the 97 Oscars?","N\u002fA","Entertainment","no","If A Complete Unknown wins the most Oscars of any nominee at the 2025 Oscars, then the market resolves to Yes.","To estimate the base rate for 'A Complete Unknown' winning the most Oscars, we must consider multiple factors such as historical trends, competition, and visibility. Historically, movies with high-profile directors, star casts, or those that perform well in precursor awards (like Golden Globes or BAFTAs) tend to win the most Oscars. Additionally, films with strong narratives or social themes resonant with current times may have an edge. Given that we do not have specific data on 'A Complete Unknown's' characteristics such as director, cast, or critical reception, and that typically, competitive fields have varied winners across categories, a base rate near the historical average of any single film leading the Oscars can be considered. Historically, a handful, typically 1 or 2, demonstrate a strong likelihood of dominating the awards. Assuming similar distribution and noting the competitive field listed, an estimated base rate could be around 0.1, acknowledging the competitive uncertainty and the typical variance in Oscars outcomes."],["KXOSCARWIN-97-A","Which movie will win the most Oscars at the 97 Oscars?","N\u002fA","Entertainment","yes","If Anora wins the most Oscars of any nominee at the 2025 Oscars, then the market resolves to Yes.","To estimate the base rate for 'Anora' winning the most Oscars, we consider historical data from past Oscar ceremonies. Historically, the movie with the most nominations often stands a good chance of winning multiple categories, but it is not always the movie with the most wins. Given the number of potential contenders and the competitive nature of the Oscars, the base rate for any single movie winning the most Oscars out of a large list of potential nominees is relatively low. A rough estimate would consider that if there are 10 movies competing, each has an equal base rate of 0.1 to win the most awards. Adjustments can be made factoring market buzz, industry expectations, trailer releases, and prior awards leading up to the Oscars, but without this specific data, a base rate of 0.1 is a general rule of thumb for any contender."],["KXOSCARSUPACTR-25-AG","Will Ariana Grande win Best Supporting Actress at the Oscars?","Ariana Grande:: Wicked","Entertainment","no","If Ariana Grande has won Best Supporting Actress at the 97th Academy Awards, then the market resolves to Yes.","To estimate the base rate for Ariana Grande winning Best Supporting Actress at the Oscars, it is important to consider several factors: the total number of nominees in the category each year, Ariana Grande's acting career status, and historical win rates. Historically, there are usually 5 nominees for Best Supporting Actress. Thus, the base rate for any individual nominee would generally be around 0.2. However, Ariana Grande's experience and presence in the film industry as an actress, compared to her status primarily as a singer with limited major acting roles, might reduce her chances relative to experienced actresses. Considering competitors who are seasoned actresses, a rough adjusted base rate estimate for her specific scenario might be closer to 0.05."],["KXOSCARSUPACTR-25-SR","Will Saoirse Ronan win Best Supporting Actress at the Oscars?","Saoirse Ronan:: Blitz","Entertainment","no","If Saoirse Ronan has won Best Supporting Actress at the 97th Academy Awards, then the market resolves to Yes.","To estimate the base rate of Saoirse Ronan winning the Best Supporting Actress Oscar, we can look at historical trends and patterns. Historically, the number of nominees in any given acting category is typically around 5. This means each nominee has an approximate chance of 1 in 5, or a 0.20 base rate. Saoirse Ronan is a critically acclaimed actress with several prior Oscar nominations, which could slightly increase her probability compared to average nominees, but without specific movie roles or competition information, this adjustment is speculative."],["KXOSCARSUPACTR-25-SG","Will Selena Gomez win Best Supporting Actress at the Oscars?","Selena Gomez:: Emilia P\u00e9rez","Entertainment","no","If Selena Gomez has won Best Supporting Actress at the 97th Academy Awards, then the market resolves to Yes.","The base rate for an actress winning an Oscar is generally quite low given the number of eligible candidates and competition each year. Since Selena Gomez has not historically been recognized for her acting at major film award ceremonies, and assuming a nomination, her chance of winning is even slimmer but still possible. Therefore, estimating the base rate needs to consider the sheer number of competitors and the competitive nature of the Oscars, leading to a base rate of approximately 0.05 for any specific actress winning."],["KXOSCARSUPACTR-25-IR","Will Isabella Rossellini win Best Supporting Actress at the Oscars?","Isabella Rossellini:: Conclave","Entertainment","no","If Isabella Rossellini has won Best Supporting Actress at the 97th Academy Awards, then the market resolves to Yes.","To estimate the base rate for Isabella Rossellini winning the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, I examined historical data for this award category. The Best Supporting Actress category typically has about five nominees each year, meaning each nominee has a base rate chance of approximately 20% (1 in 5). However, given the number of potential nominees mentioned (13), this indicates that the competition pool may be larger, reducing the base rate to around 1\u002f13 or approximately 7.7%.

Historically, with around 5 nominees in the Best Supporting Actress category, the base rate for any given nominee to win would be 1\u002f5 (0.20).

However, less than 10% of all films on Rotten Tomatoes score above 90, suggesting such scores are relatively rare overall.

Typically, a successful film with strong critical reception can achieve a score above 85.

As of now, Biden's approval ratings have been relatively stable but below 41%. Historical trends suggest approval ratings can fluctuate due to various factors like economic developments, legislative successes, or geopolitical events. Given his current approval levels and historical patterns, a modest increase above 41% within the next few months is possible, but not highly likely. Thus, I estimate a base rate slightly below 0.5."],["538APPROVEMIN-24APR30-T37","Will Biden's approval rating ever get below 37% by Apr 30, 2024?","37%","Politics","no","If, according to FiveThirtyEight, Biden's minimum approval rating is below 37 between Issuance and Apr 30, 2024, then the market resolves to Yes.","To estimate the base rate for Biden's approval rating falling below 37% by April 30, 2024, we can consider several factors: historical approval ratings for presidents, political climate, economic indicators, and recent trends in Biden's approval rating. Historically, it is not uncommon for presidents to experience fluctuations in approval ratings. Biden's rating has been hovering around the low 40s, according to FiveThirtyEight, which increases the plausibility of it dropping further, especially if there are any significant political or economic challenges within the period. However, hitting a specific low threshold, such as 37%, is relatively rare, suggesting a base rate lower than 0.5. Given these factors, a base rate around 0.3 seems reasonable."],["538APPROVEMIN-24APR30-T36","Will Biden's approval rating ever get below 36% by Apr 30, 2024?","36%","Politics","no","If, according to FiveThirtyEight, Biden's minimum approval rating is below 36 between Issuance and Apr 30, 2024, then the market resolves to Yes.","To estimate the base rate for Biden's approval rating falling below 36% by April 30, 2024, we start by reviewing historical trends and data. Historically, approval ratings for U.S. presidents can fluctuate based on a variety of factors, including economic conditions, major political events, and legislative successes or failures. Biden's approval rating has seen a decline since the beginning of his presidency, and as of October 2023, it hovers in the low 40s according to FiveThirtyEight. Given this trajectory and the time until April 2024, the likelihood of it dropping below 36% is plausible if significant negative developments occur. However, reaching sub-36% is relatively rare unless driven by severe crises. Based on historical approval data for past presidents, the probability of falling below this threshold is moderate. Thus, a reasonable base rate estimate, considering factors like potential economic challenges or political issues, is approximately 0.25."],["538APPROVEMIN-24APR30-T38","Will Biden's approval rating ever get below 38% by Apr 30, 2024?","38%","Politics","no","If, according to FiveThirtyEight, Biden's minimum approval rating is below 38 between Issuance and Apr 30, 2024, then the market resolves to Yes.","To estimate the base rate for Biden's approval rating dipping below 38% by April 30, 2024, we consider historical approval rating trends, current political conditions, and historical patterns of similar presidencies. Historically, presidential approval ratings can fluctuate due to various factors such as economic conditions, significant political events, and public perception of the president's policies. Biden's approval rating has shown volatility in response to such factors. Given recent historical data from his presidency, his approval rating has occasionally approached the low-40s. Additionally, economic uncertainties and political challenges could lead to further fluctuations. Based on these considerations and historical precedent of similar fluctuations observed in past presidencies, the base rate estimate for his approval dipping below 38% is calculated at 0.3, or a 30% chance."],["MURTHYMISSOURI","Will the Supreme Court rule that the government violated social media companies' First Amendment rights?","N\u002fA","Politics","no","If the Supreme Court rules that the government violated the First Amendment, then the market resolves to Yes.","To estimate the base rate, we consider historical Supreme Court rulings on First Amendment issues related to government involvement in private entities. Such rulings are relatively rare, especially involving direct violations against social media companies, as this is a nascent area of law. Previous rulings in similar cases usually favor maintaining the independence of these platforms but depend significantly on specific case circumstances. Estimates for successful First Amendment claim rulings against government action typically range low due to the rigorous standards required for proving a violation. Considering these factors, a low base rate is estimated due to the need for clear and compelling evidence to warrant a Supreme Court ruling of violation."],["HFHOUSING-24","Will a bill become law taxing or banning hedge funds from owning homes before election day?","Before Nov 5, 2024","Politics","no","If a bill becomes law taxing or banning investment from owning single-family homes, then the market resolves to Yes.","The base rate is derived from analyzing historical precedence of similar legal actions, political climate, and the legislative process. Historically, bills targeting specific sectors, like hedge funds in this case, face significant opposition and lobbying efforts, especially in an election cycle. Few such bills become law swiftly, especially when tackling controversial issues, making the base rate low. Additionally, the specific bill linked has only been introduced without further legislative progress, suggesting a low probability of becoming law by the given deadline."],["DEBATES24-3","Number of Trump-Biden debates?","3:: Exactly one more debate","Politics","no","If there are exactly 3 debates between the presidential nominees for the Democratic and Republican Parties, the market resolves to Yes.","Historically, there have typically been 3 presidential debates between the Democratic and Republican nominees in the general election cycle in recent elections (such as 2012, 2016, and 2020).

In 2020, there were 2 debates between Trump and Biden. Given recent trends and the rules provided, the probability of having exactly 2 debates in 2024 seems likely, although changes can occur.

For the 2024 election, information suggests that the first two debates have already occurred by September 10, 2024. Given this evidence and the common structure of prior election debates, the probability of there being exactly 1 debate (i.e., none after the mentioned dates) seems low. Therefore, the base rate for 1 debate where the nominees are the presumptive or official Democratic and Republican nominees is close to 0."],["DEBATES24-0","How many presidential debates in 2024?","0:: There have been two debates","Politics","no","If there are exactly 0 debates between the presidential nominees for the Democratic and Republican Parties, the market resolves to Yes.","Historically, presidential debates between major party candidates in US elections have been a staple since 1976, occurring for every presidential election cycle since then without exception.

Review of similar cases suggests that the federal government frequently prevails, with estimates ranging from 60% to 80%. The judiciary generally supports federal authority in intergovernmental disputes, especially when involving significant national interest like border security."],["KXECKH270","Will Harris win 270-268 - MI, PA, WI?",":: 2024-12-17T15:00:00.000Z","Politics","no","If Kamala Harris wins with exactly 270 electoral votes with the states listed below, then the market resolves to Yes.","To estimate the base rate for Kamala Harris winning exactly 270 electoral votes including MI, PA, and WI, we start by considering historical electoral outcomes. Winning exactly 270 electoral votes is a rare scenario, as it requires a very tight race with specific states won or lost by narrow margins. Historically, presidential elections are often decided by larger margins due to variations in state-level polling outcomes and unpredictable national trends. The inclusion of MI, PA, and WI as pivotal states is plausible given their historical swing state status, but the exact 270 electoral vote condition significantly narrows the probability. Based on past presidential elections and the improbability of a perfect 270 configuration, the base rate is estimated to be very low."],["MITACKMAN-24DEC31-0","How many MIT faculty will Bill Ackman accuse of plagiarism?","Above 0","Politics","no","If more than 0 MIT faculty have been accused of plagiarism by Bill Ackman by Dec 31, 2024, then the market resolves to Yes.","Bill Ackman is primarily known for his role as a hedge fund manager and investor, rather than for involvement in academic plagiarism matters.

Based on a study by the American Council on Education, the average tenure for a university president is about 7 years. Assuming a uniform distribution of departures across years, the annual probability of a president leaving is approximately 1\u002f7, or around 0.14. Given this context, it is reasonable to assume a base rate of 0.14 for the MIT president leaving her position within a year."],["KXCONGESTION-25-JAN01","Will the NYC congestion tax come into effect before 2025?","N\u002fA","Politics","no","If the NYC congestion tax is in effect before Jan 1, 2025, then the market resolves to Yes.","The NYC congestion tax was initially approved in 2019 with an expected implementation date in 2021. Delays have occurred due to federal review processes and political challenges. As of late 2023, progress has been made, including completion of necessary environmental assessments and federal approvals. Given the recent advancements and a typical case where urban transportation policies eventually get implemented, there's a moderate likelihood of it being implemented by 2025. Historical examples of urban congestion pricing implementation indicate similar timelines after initial approvals, leading to a base rate estimate reflecting these factors."],["HOUSEPA8-24-R","Will Republican win the House race for PA-8?",":: Or another Republican","Politics","yes","If the House member sworn in for PA-8 for the term beginning in 2025 is a member of Republican, then the market resolves to Yes.","To estimate the base rate for a Republican winning the PA-8 House seat in the 2025 election cycle, we can look at historical election outcomes and district demographics. PA-8 is currently represented by Democrat Matt Cartwright, but it has been a competitive district. Historically, PA-8 has swung between parties, but Democrats have held the seat since 2013. The base rate considers the recent voting trends and demographic changes, acknowledging that incumbents generally have an advantage. National trends and partisan shifts leading up to the election can also impact the competition, but without significant local or national changes, historically competitive districts like PA-8 can be volatile. For this estimate, we use historical partisan control and competitiveness of the district as the main factors."],["HOUSEPA8-24-D","Will Democratic win the House race for PA-8?",":: Or another Democrat","Politics","no","If the House member sworn in for PA-8 for the term beginning in 2025 is a member of Democratic, then the market resolves to Yes.","To estimate the base rate for a Democrat winning the PA-8 House race, I first consider historical election results. Matt Cartwright, a Democrat, has held the PA-8 seat since its creation and previously represented the area under different district numbers. This suggests incumbency advantage if he were to run. Furthermore, Pennsylvania's 8th District has had a Democratic lean, partially due to demographic and regional factors, although it has seen competitive races. Additionally, national trends can impact local races; if Democrats perform well nationally, it will benefit their candidates in this district. Taking into account these factors and the potential for a Republican candidate to be competitive, I estimate a Democratic win base rate around 0.7."],["SENATEND-24-D","Will Democratics win the Senate race in North Dakota?",":: or another Democrat","Politics","no","If Katrina Christiansen or another representative of the Democratic party is sworn in as a Senator of North Dakota for the term beginning in 2025, then the market resolves to Yes.","North Dakota is traditionally a Republican stronghold.

Arizona has been a battleground state, with its voting patterns shifting in recent elections. Historically, Arizona leaned Republican, but recent elections, such as Joe Biden's win in 2020 and Mark Kelly's victories in the Senate races, indicate a Democratic trend. In the 2022 Senate race, Democrat Mark Kelly won re-election. Considering these factors, the base rate is set to reflect a relatively balanced but slightly Democratic-leaning electorate."],["SENATEAZ-24-D","Will Democratics win the Senate race in Arizona?",":: or another Democrat","Politics","yes","If Ruben Gallego or another representative of the Democratic party is sworn in as a Senator of Arizona for the term beginning in 2025, then the market resolves to Yes.","To estimate the base rate, we consider historical election outcomes in Arizona, current political trends, and the competitiveness of the candidates. Arizona has recently been a battleground state with close Senate races. In 2018, Democrat Kyrsten Sinema won the Senate seat, and in 2020, Democrat Mark Kelly also won. This indicates a shift towards Democratic competitiveness. Given this context, and assuming no significant changes in political dynamics leading to the 2024 Senate race, the base rate of a Democrat winning the Senate race is roughly around the 50% mark. This accounts for the recent history of Arizona elections and remains adaptable to changing election dynamics."],["SENATEWI-24-R","Will Republicans win the Senate race in Wisconsin?",":: or another Republican","Politics","no","If Eric Hovde or another representative of the Republican party is sworn in as a Senator of Wisconsin for the term beginning in 2025, then the market resolves to Yes.","The base rate for the event is estimated using historical election outcomes and current political landscape. Wisconsin has been known for closely contested elections in recent years. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, won re-election in 2018, but the state's election outcomes have varied between Democratic and Republican victories. Considering this variability and Wisconsin's status as a swing state, the base rate for a Republican victory is estimated at approximately 0.5, reflecting the competitive nature of polling and historical outcomes."],["SENATEWI-24-D","Will Democratics win the Senate race in Wisconsin?",":: or another Democrat","Politics","yes","If Tammy Baldwin or another representative of the Democratic party is sworn in as a Senator of Wisconsin for the term beginning in 2025, then the market resolves to Yes.","Tammy Baldwin, an incumbent Democrat, served as a Senator from Wisconsin since 2013 and has been elected twice. Historical election data suggests incumbents generally have a higher chance of re-election due to name recognition and established political networks.

Lighthizer, being a former U.S. Trade Representative, certainly has political experience but has not previously held a Treasury-specific role. Other potential candidates listed vary from seasoned political figures to former executives and financiers, each with varying degrees of probability. Since the list contains 11 candidates, an initial even probability (base rate) across all candidates would include Lighthizer at about 0.09.

However, Kudlow's prior role as Director of the National Economic Council under Trump and his continued influence in conservative economic circles could slightly favor his consideration as a candidate. Despite these factors, the likelihood remains low compared to candidates with more traditional backgrounds in government or finance.

Historically, leadership positions in the Senate, especially for major parties, have been held by long-serving members with significant influence. John Thune, as of the last update, was the Senate Minority Whip, which is the second-highest position in the Senate Republican leadership. This places him in a favorable succession position should Mitch McConnell step down or Republicans remain in the minority after the next elections. Assessing patterns, leadership changes typically occur when the current leader steps down due to retirement, electoral loss, or internal party leadership challenges. Given that McConnell's tenure has seen occasional speculation about his potential retirement, the probability of Thune ascending to Minority Leader could be increased.

Since the 1980s, only a few election cycles resulted in a party having precisely 52 Senate seats at any point. Given these historical patterns, combined with current political trends and recent election results, we might consider a low probability for exactly 52 seats, around 15%.

Recent trends and demographic shifts, as well as election outcomes, show that a slight majority is a fairly common outcome. Given the current polarization and close competition between the two major parties, a single seat majority is a plausible scenario.

Moreover, the time frame until 2028 leaves room for settlements or case dismissals, which are common outcomes. Generally, successful outcomes in such cases for plaintiffs are less than 50%, especially given the resources available to both parties for prolonged legal battles. Based on these factors, the estimate accounts for a 30% base rate of success, a conservative figure reflecting the uncertain nature of such legal disputes."],["NETFLIXSUBS-24-Q2-9.33","Netflix subscribers gain in 2024 Q2?","9.33 million:: Netflix expectation: below 9.33M","Companies","no","If Netflix adds 9.33 million subscribers or more in 2024 Q2, then the market resolves to Yes.","To estimate the base rate for Netflix adding 9.33 million subscribers or more in Q2 2024, we analyze historical subscriber growth data for Q2 over recent years.

First, Belichick has strong ties and a longstanding relationship with the Patriots organization. Second, the Chicago Bears may not align with Belichick's preferences in terms of team strength or organizational culture. Additionally, the Bears have a wide array of potential candidates to consider, making the appointment of Belichick less likely.

Based on these points, a conservative base rate estimation is appropriate."],["KXNEWCOACHNYJ-25-BJ","Who will be the next New York Jets coach?","Ben Johnson","Sports","no","If Ben Johnson is announced to be the next coach of the New York Jets, then the market resolves to Yes.","The base rate for Ben Johnson being selected as the next New York Jets head coach can be estimated by looking at historical NFL head coach hiring trends. There are 15 potential candidates listed, which gives each candidate a naive even chance of 1\u002f15 or approximately 0.067 if candidates are equally likely. However, not all candidates are equally likely given their current career trajectories, reputations, or prior connections to the team. Without specific insider information about the Jets' preferences or the candidates' desire for the job, we adhere to the naive base rate as a starting point.

NFL teams change coaches frequently, and external candidates often have a chance, but internal promotions and local hires tend to be more common. Calculate the share of external coaches chosen versus internal\u002fexisting in past cases. Vrabel, currently coaching elsewhere, would need significant motivation to switch teams. Considering the array of candidates and Vrabel's relatively stable position, the base rate should be calibrated accordingly."],["KXNEWCOACHNYJ-25-MN","Who will be the next New York Jets coach?","Matt Nagy","Sports","no","If Matt Nagy is announced to be the next coach of the New York Jets, then the market resolves to Yes.","Estimating the base rate for Matt Nagy becoming the next New York Jets head coach requires considering his prior experience, the likelihood of head coaching changes, and historical hiring trends in the NFL. With prior experience as a head coach at the Chicago Bears and current offensive coordinator role at the Kansas City Chiefs, Nagy is a potential candidate. The base rate can be affected by the typical turnover of NFL coaches, which is relatively high, and that teams often seek experienced candidates. Among many potential candidates, the likelihood of any one individual being chosen is low, reflecting typical probabilities for specific individuals being hired in such roles."],["KXNEWCOACHNYJ-25-JU","Who will be the next New York Jets coach?","Jeff Ulbrich","Sports","no","If Jeff Ulbrich is announced to be the next coach of the New York Jets, then the market resolves to Yes.","The base rate estimation involves analyzing historical data for interim defensive coordinators being promoted to head coaching roles in the NFL, as well as the specific context of the New York Jets' organizational behavior and current performance. On average, internal promotions to head coach roles in the NFL occur at a modest rate, especially for coordinators versus more experienced head coaching candidates.

Historically, the Jets have changed coaches approximately once every 2-3 years, indicating a moderate turnover rate. Additionally, being potentially included in the list suggests that there is some probability assigned to each candidate. Given the competition of 15 candidates, a naive base rate could be 1\u002f15. Considerations also include Glenn's current status as a defensive coordinator, the Jets potentially needing defensive leadership, and any recent news or connections specifically linking him to the Jets. Assuming no standout differences between candidates that would significantly alter probabilities, an adjusted base rate slightly below the naive estimate considers intrinsic coaching turnover, connections mentions, and matching coaching style needs."],["KXNEWCOACHNYJ-25-BB","Who will be the next New York Jets coach?","Bill Belichick","Sports","no","If Bill Belichick is announced to be the next coach of the New York Jets, then the market resolves to Yes.","The base rate estimate is derived from multiple factors. Historically, it is very rare for high-profile head coaches like Bill Belichick to switch to a long-time division rival NFL team such as the New York Jets, especially given Belichick's long tenure and success with the New England Patriots. The likelihood of active high-profile coaches moving to a new head coaching role within the NFL, especially late in their career, is quite low without significant motivating factors. Given these considerations, along with the long list of other potential candidates, the base rate of Bill Belichick becoming the Jets' head coach is estimated to be low."],["KXNEWCOACHNO-25-DS","Who will be the next New Orleans Saints head coach?","David Shaw","Sports","no","If David Shaw is announced to be the next head coach of the New Orleans Saints, then the market resolves to Yes.","To determine the base rate for David Shaw becoming the next head coach of the New Orleans Saints, we start by evaluating the historical frequency of such appointments. Hiring practices for NFL head coaching positions often involve various candidate pools including former NFL head coaches, NFL coordinators, and successful college coaches. Shaw is in the category of a successful college coach, which historically has a lower transition rate to NFL head coach positions compared to candidates with NFL experience. Considering the list of other candidates, many with NFL experience and some with existing connections to the Saints or current NFL coaching roles, Shaw's base rate should be lower. Historically, the likelihood for college coaches without previous NFL head coaching experience to secure an NFL head coach position in any given instance tends to be low, often under 10%. Given this context, we approximate a conservative base rate of 0.05 for David Shaw given the multiplicity of candidates and the historical patterns."],["KXNEWCOACHNO-25-AG","Who will be the next New Orleans Saints head coach?","Aaron Glenn","Sports","no","If Aaron Glenn is announced to be the next head coach of the New Orleans Saints, then the market resolves to Yes.","The base rate for an individual candidate becoming a head coach can be approximated by analyzing historical data on NFL head coach hires. In recent years, there have been around 32 NFL teams with an average of around 5-7 head coaching changes per year, resulting in roughly 16-21% chance for any given team to change coaches in one year, which would be distributed among potential candidates. Assuming a short list of about 10 viable candidates for any head coach opening, we might estimate a base rate of about 10% for Aaron Glenn, given that he's one of several candidates mentioned, without any additional context that suggests he is a particularly strong frontrunner over the others at this point in time."],["KXNEWCOACHNO-25-KK","Who will be the next New Orleans Saints coach?","Klint Kubiak","Sports","no","If Klint Kubiak is announced to be the next coach of the New Orleans Saints, then the market resolves to Yes.","Estimating the base rate for Klint Kubiak becoming the next head coach of the New Orleans Saints involves considering historical hiring trends in the NFL and Kubiak's current coaching profile. Historically, head coach appointments often come from a pool of experienced NFL coordinators, former head coaches, or standout position coaches. Klint Kubiak has experience as an offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach, increasing his visibility for head coaching roles. When assessing probability, assuming an equal chance among listed candidates provides a rough base rate. With 10 potential candidates listed, the naive probability is around 0.1.

Typically, when teams hire new head coaches, they may choose from different candidate pools, such as existing NFL coordinators, former NFL head coaches, or successful college coaches. Given that Joe Brady has previous experience in the NFL and as a head coach in college, his chances are influenced by this diverse pool. Historically, the probability of any single named candidate being chosen from a shortlist is relatively low given the number of strong candidates often available. Out of the listed options, none, including Brady, are clear frontrunners based on available public information as of now.

Typically, predicting a specific coach for a team involves assessing their previous interest in the coach, the coach's current career trajectory, and historical patterns of coach hiring. Eric Bieniemy has been a notable candidate in head coach discussions over the years due to his successful tenure as an offensive coordinator. The general base rate for any specific individual to become a head coach of an NFL team is relatively low considering the number of potential candidates and circumstances influencing team decisions. However, Bieniemy being frequently mentioned raises this base slightly, though competition is fierce as outlined with multiple other candidates. Historically, Bieniemy has been interviewed for head coach roles but has not been hired, which moderates the estimate."],["KXNEWCOACHNO-25-DR","Who will be the next New Orleans Saints coach?","Darren Rizzi","Sports","no","If Darren Rizzi is announced to be the next coach of the New Orleans Saints, then the market resolves to Yes.","To estimate the base rate of Darren Rizzi becoming the next head coach of the New Orleans Saints, we consider historical data on assistant coaches being promoted to head coach within the same NFL team. Over the last decade, approximately 15-20% of NFL teams have promoted an existing assistant to head coach. Given Rizzi's position as special teams coordinator with the Saints since 2019 and his established rapport within the organization, along with the tendency of NFL teams to favor internal promotions for stability, a base rate of 0.15 is considered reasonable for this scenario."],["KXNEWCOACHNO-25-BJ","Who will be the next New Orleans Saints coach?","Ben Johnson","Sports","no","If Ben Johnson is announced to be the next coach of the New Orleans Saints, then the market resolves to Yes.","Estimating the base rate involves considering historical hiring trends in the NFL for head coaches, the prominence and current status of Ben Johnson, and the typical likelihood of any specific candidate being hired when multiple options are being considered. NFL teams typically consider a wide pool of candidates for head coaching positions, including established coordinators, former head coaches, and less conventional candidates with potential upside.

Considering the competitive nature of the league, a simplistic base rate calculation assuming all teams have an equal chance each year would be 1\u002f30. However, factors such as team performance, roster strength, and management decisions can affect actual outcomes each season. The 76ers' historical win rate is also approximately 3\u002f77 (since their founding in 1946), but given league changes and the team's competitive edge in recent seasons, a slightly modified base rate accounting for these factors provides a more realistic picture."],["KXNBA-25-SAS","Will the San Antonio Spurs win the NBA Finals?","N\u002fA","Sports","no","If the San Antonio basketball team wins the Pro Men's Basketball Championship, then the market resolves to Yes.","The base rate is derived from historical data of NBA Finals outcomes.

However, considering the Suns' recent competitive status, having reached the NBA Finals in 2021, their base rate should be adjusted slightly upward.

Historically, the Lakers have been one of the most successful teams in NBA history, with 17 championships. For a longer-term forecast to a future date like 2027, it would be reasonable to consider broader competitive dynamics in the league. The NBA has 30 teams, implying a naive base rate of 1\u002f30 \u2248 0.033. However, given the Lakers' historical success and market advantages, it's rational to assign a slightly higher probability than the uniform distribution.
