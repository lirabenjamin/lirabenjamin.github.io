<div id="its-not-under-your-control-you-should-try-again"
class="section level1">
<h1>It’s not under your control: You should try again!</h1>
<p>In most cases, when people think that things are under their control,
they persist more. However, It appears this is not always the case, and
there might be conditions under which people try harder in the presence
of uncertainty. Gambling, for example, is notorious for generating
highly persistent behavior that comes at a cost to the individual,
despite it entailing a high amount of uncertainty.</p>
<p>A separate but related case is that overweighting personal control
(and underweighting the role of circumstance) leads to reduced effort,
where more is warranted. When I took the GRE, I did fine, but not great.
I wasn’t particularly motivated to try again, because I thought my score
was unlikely to improve with the study I could do in the three week
period. The increase in study time was marginal, so I predicted an
equally marginal increase in my score. This led me to feel like spending
$200 on the test made no sense. I was underestimating the role of
outside factors and overemphasizing the role of studying on GRE
performance. I wasn’t thinking that I might get questions for which I
was more prepared, my mood might be better, and so on. Overestimating
the amount of personal control I had over the score, probably had an
undue impact on my motivation to persist. Maybe, had I been more aware
of the randomness associated with my performance, I might have been more
inclined to persist.</p>
<p>Learned helplessness and random interval reinforcement In animal
models, there are two paradigms that come to mind that deal with
uncertainty and situations we can or can’t control. Learned helplessness
and random interval reinforcement produce diverging behavioral
responses, with both having an element of uncertainty.</p>
<p>In learned helplessness, the animal quickly learns that its behavior
cannot help it avoid an electric shock, so it quickly learns to give up.
On random interval reinforcement, an animal might get rewarded after a
random time, or a random amount of pecks to a button.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 1.</strong> <em>Reinforcement schedules produce
different behavioral responses (Stangor &amp; Walinga, 2014).</em></p>

<p>Why is random reinforcement motivating, whereas learned helplessness
isn’t? Attribution theory might provide a framework for evaluating these
questions.</p>
<p>Some thoughts on attribution theory</p>
<p>A 2x2 on influences/attribution – The one we discussed on our call We
can split what affects performance in a 2x2. There are things relating
to me (i.e., talent, learned skill, effort), and things that are
environmental (i.e., discrimination, structural barriers, luck). These
can also be classified as things that are mostly fixed (e.g,
discrimination and talent), and things that are mostly variable (e.g.,
skill and luck).</p>
<p><strong>Figure 2.</strong> <em>A 2x2 of Dispositional/Situational and
Controllable/Uncontrollable</em></p>
<p><img
src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/BOwvE64rQiZaT4OwXHaPQy2_0pMHg0R3GDsRyPsX5vCRyBO_rwNrVbFzcNf6z8UrRVUanZoV9kFnf82VYzoS-kp7pJfdZ4fdMY8THUgrnKZN_XpVmKpDPEZyAb-B85rry7tAaPE6" /></p>
<p>It should be noted however that in our call we conflated the
stability dimension with the controllability dimension. Learned
helplessness is the generalization of lack of control after repeated
exposure to negative uncontrollable and stable situations.</p>
<p>Weiner’s attributional theory Weiner’s attributional theory (1985)
posits a 2x2x2 of attribution composed of locus (situational
vs. dispositional), controllability, and stability. The difference
between stability and controllability explains why learned helplessness
is so different from a random reinforcement schedule. In both learned
helplessness and random reinforcement there is lack of control. However,
learned helplessness is a stable uncontrollable situation (it is always
the same and you can’t do anything about it), whereas random
reinforcement schedules are unstable uncontrollable situations (it
always changes, but you can’t control when the reward is coming).</p>
<p>Uncertainty affects motivation differently whether it’s stable or
unstable. If we think our achievement is determined by negative fixed
environmental variables, we would try less hard. That is what is
happening when an animal has learned helplessness. On the other hand,I
don’t think there are strong predictions to be made when we interpret
the situation to be partly uncontrollable, but unstable.</p>
<p>Seligman’s model of explanatory style Marty’s model of exploratory
style is also a 2x2x2, but instead of having a controllability
dimension, it has a specificity/pervasiveness dimension that specifies
whether the attribution is domain-specific (e.g., I flunked this
particular test) vs. domain general (I am bad at school; Gillham, et
al., 2001).</p>
<p>I think Carol Dweck’s idea of a growth vs. a fixed mindset (Dweck
&amp; Legget, 1988) has very much explained the origins and consequences
of the stability dimension applied to the self. Far less is known about
how we come to make judgments about the controllability and stability of
a situation. These questions might be even more important in unfamiliar
one-shot situations. When I take the GRE once, my growth/fixed mindset
explains how stably I’ll judge my dispositional qualities. It might be
hard for someone in that situation to calibrate how much my score might
be dependent on unstable uncontrollable causes.</p>
<p>It is likely that we might have a default position for how to judge
the controllability and stability of a situation that might not be the
ideal. Maybe nudging people to make the unstable or uncontrollable
aspects of a situation more salient can improve perseverance.</p>
<p>An experimental paradigm How might we devise a task to study these
phenomena experimentally? Say we take a group of subjects and ask them
to perform a game-like task from which they get a score. They are told
that they are competing against other participants for prize money.
After they are familiarized with the game, we might give them some
feedback about what leads to good performance on the game, how it’s
scored, and what was their performance.</p>
<p>Performance on the task is largely explained by genetic causes
Performance on the task is largely explained by practice Dispositional,
uncontrollable, stable Dispositional, controllable, unstable Your score
on the task is non-random Your score will have added or subtracted
points Controllable, (Vague stability) Uncontrollable, Unstable Your
pupils show you were giving maximum effort Your pupils show you are
capable of exerting more effort Dispositional, Uncontrollable, Stable
Dispositional, Controllable, Unstable</p>
<p>After that feedback, participants would be able to keep trying to
improve their score in the game. As a DV, the amount of tries the
participant completes, or the improvement on their score can be
objective measures of persistence.</p>

<h1>Some thoughts on deliberate practice</h1>
<p>2020 | 03 | 10</p>
<p>I learned about deliberate practice some years ago already. The idea
stuck with me early on. I think this was because I had already
experienced it, without knowing what it was. During my last years of
high school, my parents got my little brother a digital keyboard. Soon,
I was spending entire afternoons on the weekends putting my fingers
where the keyboard lit up. Since I couldn’t read notation, I added one
note at a time, until an entire passage was memorized. This forced me to
keep my objective hyper-specific: add a single note. The aggregation of
those tiny objectives, however, was much more meaningful. After some
hours of practice, I could play a simplified version of the second
movement of Beethoven’s Pathetique sonata.</p>
<p>Some years later, when I learned about deliberate practice, I
understood why that was so effective. Here are some interesting insights
I’ve gained from practicing deliberately:</p>
<ul>
<li>It does not get any easier. This can be very frustrating, because
deliberate practice itself is often <em>not</em> enjoyable. Being aware
of this is very important, because I often fool myself to avoid the
feeling of it being hard. I might noodle around, I might practice what I
already know, I might outright procrastinate. Knowing that practice is
not supposed to feel fluent is helpful, since we often think that
fluency is required for learning (Hint: It’s the opposite).</li>
<li>Making deliberate practice into a habit helps deal with the fact
that it is hard. Habits help because they make a behavior automatic. If
we skip thinking “this will be effortful” we are more likely to follow
through.</li>
<li>Not everything is as easy as piano. There’s no wonder why Erikson
studied practice in certain fields where deliberate practice is easy.
Music, chess, and sports make great things to practice deliberately
because they are concrete: they have instant feedback, predefined
behaviors, they can easily be broken down into components. More abstract
endeavors like becoming a good researcher require more work in terms of
deciding how we can practice them more effectively.</li>
</ul>
