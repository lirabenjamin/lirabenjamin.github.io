# **Benjamin Lira Luttges**

I am a third year graduate student in Psychology at the [University of Pennsylvania](upenn.edu). I am working with [Dr. Angela Duckworth](angeladuckworth.com).

I hope to contribute to psychological science by improving our understanding of how non-cognitive skills develop and how we can better assess them, and the practices that lead to their development. I employ network science methods to better understand how non-congitive skills develop and machine learning (particularly natural language processing) to better measure them and the practices that lead to their improvement. My work has been published in *Educational Researcher*, *Nature Scientific Reports*, and *Science Advances*. THIS IS A TEST

Prior to my doctoral studies at Penn, I graduated summa cum laude from the University of Lima with a BA and a licensure in Psychology, and worked developing interventions, training, and outreach on Educational Neuroscience and Psychology.
