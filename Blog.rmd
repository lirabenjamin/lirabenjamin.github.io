# It's not under your control: You should try again!

In most cases, when people think that things are under their control, they persist more. However, It appears this is not always the case, and there might be conditions under which people try harder in the presence of uncertainty. Gambling, for example, is notorious for generating highly persistent behavior that comes at a cost to the individual, despite it entailing a high amount of uncertainty.

A separate but related case is that overweighting personal control (and underweighting the role of circumstance) leads to reduced effort, where more is warranted. When I took the GRE, I did fine, but not great. I wasn't particularly motivated to try again, because I thought my score was unlikely to improve with the study I could do in the three week period. The increase in study time was marginal, so I predicted an equally marginal increase in my score. This led me to feel like spending \$200 on the test made no sense. I was underestimating the role of outside factors and overemphasizing the role of studying on GRE performance. I wasn't thinking that I might get questions for which I was more prepared, my mood might be better, and so on. Overestimating the amount of personal control I had over the score, probably had an undue impact on my motivation to persist. Maybe, had I been more aware of the randomness associated with my performance, I might have been more inclined to persist.

Learned helplessness and random interval reinforcement In animal models, there are two paradigms that come to mind that deal with uncertainty and situations we can or can't control. Learned helplessness and random interval reinforcement produce diverging behavioral responses, with both having an element of uncertainty.

In learned helplessness, the animal quickly learns that its behavior cannot help it avoid an electric shock, so it quickly learns to give up. On random interval reinforcement, an animal might get rewarded after a random time, or a random amount of pecks to a button.

Why is random reinforcement motivating, whereas learned helplessness isn't? Attribution theory might provide a framework for evaluating these questions.

Some thoughts on attribution theory

A 2x2 on influences/attribution -- The one we discussed on our call We can split what affects performance in a 2x2. There are things relating to me (i.e., talent, learned skill, effort), and things that are environmental (i.e., discrimination, structural barriers, luck). These can also be classified as things that are mostly fixed (e.g, discrimination and talent), and things that are mostly variable (e.g., skill and luck).

It should be noted however that in our call we conflated the stability dimension with the controllability dimension. Learned helplessness is the generalization of lack of control after repeated exposure to negative uncontrollable and stable situations.

Weiner's attributional theory Weiner's attributional theory (1985) posits a 2x2x2 of attribution composed of locus (situational vs. dispositional), controllability, and stability. The difference between stability and controllability explains why learned helplessness is so different from a random reinforcement schedule. In both learned helplessness and random reinforcement there is lack of control. However, learned helplessness is a stable uncontrollable situation (it is always the same and you can't do anything about it), whereas random reinforcement schedules are unstable uncontrollable situations (it always changes, but you can't control when the reward is coming).

Uncertainty affects motivation differently whether it's stable or unstable. If we think our achievement is determined by negative fixed environmental variables, we would try less hard. That is what is happening when an animal has learned helplessness. On the other hand,I don't think there are strong predictions to be made when we interpret the situation to be partly uncontrollable, but unstable.

Seligman's model of explanatory style Marty's model of exploratory style is also a 2x2x2, but instead of having a controllability dimension, it has a specificity/pervasiveness dimension that specifies whether the attribution is domain-specific (e.g., I flunked this particular test) vs. domain general (I am bad at school; Gillham, et al., 2001).

I think Carol Dweck's idea of a growth vs. a fixed mindset (Dweck & Legget, 1988) has very much explained the origins and consequences of the stability dimension applied to the self. Far less is known about how we come to make judgments about the controllability and stability of a situation. These questions might be even more important in unfamiliar one-shot situations. When I take the GRE once, my growth/fixed mindset explains how stably I'll judge my dispositional qualities. It might be hard for someone in that situation to calibrate how much my score might be dependent on unstable uncontrollable causes.

It is likely that we might have a default position for how to judge the controllability and stability of a situation that might not be the ideal. Maybe nudging people to make the unstable or uncontrollable aspects of a situation more salient can improve perseverance.

An experimental paradigm How might we devise a task to study these phenomena experimentally? Say we take a group of subjects and ask them to perform a game-like task from which they get a score. They are told that they are competing against other participants for prize money. After they are familiarized with the game, we might give them some feedback about what leads to good performance on the game, how it's scored, and what was their performance.

Performance on the task is largely explained by genetic causes Performance on the task is largely explained by practice Dispositional, uncontrollable, stable Dispositional, controllable, unstable Your score on the task is non-random Your score will have added or subtracted points Controllable, (Vague stability) Uncontrollable, Unstable Your pupils show you were giving maximum effort Your pupils show you are capable of exerting more effort Dispositional, Uncontrollable, Stable Dispositional, Controllable, Unstable

After that feedback, participants would be able to keep trying to improve their score in the game. As a DV, the amount of tries the participant completes, or the improvement on their score can be objective measures of persistence.

# Some thoughts on deliberate practice

2020 \| 03 \| 10

I learned about deliberate practice some years ago already. The idea stuck with me early on. I think this was because I had already experienced it, without knowing what it was. During my last years of high school, my parents got my little brother a digital keyboard. Soon, I was spending entire afternoons on the weekends putting my fingers where the keyboard lit up. Since I couldn't read notation, I added one note at a time, until an entire passage was memorized. This forced me to keep my objective hyper-specific: add a single note. The aggregation of those tiny objectives, however, was much more meaningful. After some hours of practice, I could play a simplified version of the second movement of Beethoven's Pathetique sonata.

Some years later, when I learned about deliberate practice, I understood why that was so effective. Here are some interesting insights I've gained from practicing deliberately:

-   It does not get any easier. This can be very frustrating, because deliberate practice itself is often *not* enjoyable. Being aware of this is very important, because I often fool myself to avoid the feeling of it being hard. I might noodle around, I might practice what I already know, I might outright procrastinate. Knowing that practice is not supposed to feel fluent is helpful, since we often think that fluency is required for learning (Hint: It's the opposite).
-   Making deliberate practice into a habit helps deal with the fact that it is hard. Habits help because they make a behavior automatic. If we skip thinking "this will be effortful" we are more likely to follow through.
-   Not everything is as easy as piano. There's no wonder why Erikson studied practice in certain fields where deliberate practice is easy. Music, chess, and sports make great things to practice deliberately because they are concrete: they have instant feedback, predefined behaviors, they can easily be broken down into components. More abstract endeavors like becoming a good researcher require more work in terms of deciding how we can practice them more effectively.
