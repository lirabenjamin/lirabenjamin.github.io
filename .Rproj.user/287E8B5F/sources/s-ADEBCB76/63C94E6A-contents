# **Benjamin Lira Luttges**

I am a first year graduate student in Psychology at the [University of Pennsylvania](upenn.edu). I am working with Dr. Angela Duckworth.

I hope to contribute to psychological science by improving our understanding on how adversity affects self-control. Hopefully, this knowledge can be used in the future for the development of targeted interventions that help children and adolescents develop strategies to bridge the self-control gap between the rich and the poor. My work has been published in *Educational Researcher*.

Prior to my doctoral studies at Penn, I graduated summa cum laude from the University of Lima with a BA and a licensure in Psychology, and worked developing interventions, trainings, and outreach on Educational Neuroscience and Psychology.
